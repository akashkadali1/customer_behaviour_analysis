### **Customer Shopping Behaviour Analysis**



#### **Overview**



This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to uncover actionable business insights. Using Python, SQL Server, and Power BI, the analysis focuses on customer demographics, purchasing patterns, revenue drivers, and segmentation. The final output includes a dashboard, a written report, and a presentation for stakeholder communication.



#### **Dataset**



* Source: Customer shopping behaviour dataset



* Records: ~3,900 transactions



* Data includes:



    Customer demographics (age, gender, subscription status)



    Purchase details (category, amount, discounts, shipping type)



    Ratings and review-related attributes



#### **Tools \& Technologies**



* **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn



* **SQL:** SQL Server (joins, aggregations, filtering)



* **BI Tool:** Power BI



* **Presentation:** Gamma



* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook



#### **Project Steps**



**1.Data Loading**



* Imported raw CSV data into Python using Pandas.



**2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**



* Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships.



* Identified missing values and outliers.



**3.Data Cleaning \& Feature Engineering**



* Handled missing values and inconsistent data.



* Created derived features such as age groups and purchase frequency.



**4.SQL Analysis**



* Loaded cleaned data into SQL Server.



* Wrote queries to analyze revenue, customer segments, and product performance.



**5.Dashboard Development**



* Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize KPIs and trends.



**6.Reporting \& Presentation**



* Summarized insights in a structured report.



* Created a presentation using Gamma for non-technical stakeholders.

###### 

#### **Dashboard**



The Power BI dashboard highlights:



* Revenue by customer demographics



* High-value and discount-driven customers



* Product performance and customer ratings



* Impact of shipping type and subscriptions on spending



#### **Key Results \& Insights**



* Subscription customers contribute significantly higher revenue than non-subscribers.



* Express shipping users show higher average purchase value.



* Certain product categories consistently receive higher customer ratings.



* A large portion of customers are new, indicating opportunities for retention and loyalty programs.
